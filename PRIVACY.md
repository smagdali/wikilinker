# Wikilinker Privacy Policy

## What Wikilinker does

Wikilinker is a browser extension that automatically adds Wikipedia links to news articles on supported sites. All processing happens locally in your browser.

## Data collection

Wikilinker does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. Specifically:

- **No browsing data** is sent to any server. The extension runs entirely in your browser.
- **No analytics or tracking.** There are no telemetry, usage metrics, or crash reports.
- **No user accounts.** There is no sign-up, login, or authentication of any kind.
- **No cookies** are set by the extension.
- **No third-party services** are contacted. Entity matching uses a bundled database of Wikipedia article titles — no network requests are made by the extension.

## Data storage

The extension stores two preferences (enabled/disabled and all-sites mode) using your browser's local extension storage. These values never leave your device.

## Permissions

- **Host permissions** (19 news site domains): Required to inject Wikipedia links into article text on supported sites. The extension only activates on these specific domains.
- **Optional host permissions** (`<all_urls>`): Requested only when you enable "all sites" mode. Allows the extension to run on any website. You can revoke this at any time by toggling the setting off.
- **Storage**: Used to save preferences.
- **Active tab**: Used to communicate with the content script on the current page.
- **Scripting**: Used to inject the content script into pages when "all sites" mode is enabled.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published here and in the extension stores.
