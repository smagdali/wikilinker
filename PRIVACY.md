# Wikilinker Privacy Policy

## What Wikilinker does

Wikilinker is a browser extension that automatically adds Wikipedia links to news articles on supported sites. All processing happens locally in your browser.

## Data collection

Wikilinker does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. Specifically:

- **No browsing data** is sent to any server. The extension runs entirely in your browser.
- **No analytics or tracking.** There are no telemetry, usage metrics, or crash reports.
- **No user accounts.** There is no sign-up, login, or authentication of any kind.
- **No cookies** are set by the extension.
- **No third-party services** are contacted. Entity matching uses a bundled database of Wikipedia article titles — no network requests are made by the extension.

## Data storage

The extension stores a single boolean preference (enabled/disabled) using your browser's local extension storage. This value never leaves your device.

## Permissions

- **Host permissions** (19 news site domains): Required to inject Wikipedia links into article text on supported sites. The extension only activates on these specific domains.
- **Storage**: Used to save the enabled/disabled preference.
- **Active tab**: Used to communicate with the content script on the current page.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published here and in the extension stores.
