# Store Listing — Wikilinker

## Short description (used in manifest.json and store summary)

Auto-links proper nouns and entities to Wikipedia on news sites

## Chrome Web Store — Detailed description

Wikilinker automatically adds Wikipedia links to the people, places, organizations, and other notable entities mentioned in news articles. Each entity is linked only on its first occurrence, keeping the reading experience clean.

How it works: When you visit a supported news site, Wikilinker scans the article text for proper nouns and acronyms, matches them against a bundled database of 500,000 popular Wikipedia titles, and adds unobtrusive links directly in the page. All processing happens locally in your browser — no data is sent anywhere.

Supported sites: BBC News, AP News, NPR, Al Jazeera, NBC News, CBS News, Fox News, USA Today, Daily Mail, The Independent, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Vox, The Guardian, CNN, ABC News, Sky News, and UnHerd.

Features:
- 500,000 entity database bundled locally — no network requests
- First-occurrence-only linking keeps articles readable
- Smart filtering avoids false positives on common words
- One-click enable/disable from the toolbar popup
- Works on 19 major news sites
